# Guidelines
## position yourself properly in the root folder (I used CMD for this task)
- cd Desktop\contact_form_automation  (this is my example)

## run wanted file from the root folder
- pytest tests/test_contact_form_negative.py -v
- pytest tests/test_contact_form_positive.py -v
- pytest tests/test_fail_scenario.py -v

## or run full suite
- pytest tests/ -v

## run from root and create reports
- pytest tests/test_contact_form_negative.py -v --html=reports/report.html
- pytest tests/test_contact_form_positive.py -v --html=reports/report.html
- pytest tests/test_fail_scenario.py -v --html=reports/report.html
- pytest tests/ -v --html=reports/report.html

## Additional notes:
- in conftest.py file choose headless option if wanted
- in utils/config.py change URL if needed
- in utils/helpers.py change email function to generate either new domain or local part
